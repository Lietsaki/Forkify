# Forkify

Forkify allows you to search and browse recipes using three keywords: 'Pizza', 'Bacon' and 'Broccoli', which come from different websites and are gathered by the Forkify API.

Features:

- Get a list of ingredients for any recipe based on the number of servings you choose.
- Change the amount of each ingredient to suit your taste.
- 'Like' recipes to acccess them from a handy tab when you navigate to other recipes or even after reloading the browser.
- Nice pagination system showing 10 recipes in each page.
- Check the instructions to cook any recipe in their original website.

Note:  I worked on this project to learn JavaScript and hence it is not original work.
